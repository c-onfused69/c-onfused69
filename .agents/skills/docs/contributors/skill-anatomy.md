# Anatomy of a Skill - Understanding the Structure

**Want to understand how skills work under the hood?** This guide breaks down every part of a skill file.

---

## 📁 Basic Folder Structure

```
skills/
└── my-skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md              ← Required: The main skill definition
    ├── examples/             ← Optional: Example files
    │   ├── example1.js
    │   └── example2.py
    ├── scripts/              ← Optional: Helper scripts
    │   └── helper.sh
    ├── templates/            ← Optional: Code templates
    │   └── template.tsx
    ├── references/           ← Optional: Reference documentation
    │   └── api-docs.md
    └── README.md             ← Optional: Additional documentation
```

**Key Rule:** Only `SKILL.md` is required. Everything else is optional!

## SKILL.md Structure

Every `SKILL.md` file has two main parts:

### 1. Frontmatter (Metadata)
### 2. Content (Instructions)

Let's break down each part:

---

## Part 1: Frontmatter

The frontmatter is at the very top, wrapped in `---`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: "Brief description of what this skill does"
category: development
risk: safe
source: community
source_repo: owner/repo
source_type: community
date_added: "YYYY-MM-DD"
---
```

### Required Fields

#### `name`
- **What it is:** The skill's identifier
- **Format:** lowercase-with-hyphens
- **Must match:** The folder name exactly
- **Example:** `stripe-integration`

#### `description`
- **What it is:** One-sentence summary
- **Format:** String in quotes
- **Length:** Keep it under 200 characters
- **Example:** `"Stripe payment integration patterns including checkout, subscriptions, and webhooks"`

#### `category`
- **What it is:** Primary grouping used by generated indexes and catalog surfaces
- **Format:** Lowercase category label
- **Example:** `category: development`
- **Note:** Tooling can infer a category for legacy skills, but new skills should declare one explicitly.

#### `risk`
- **What it is:** The safety classification of the skill
- **Values:** `none` | `safe` | `critical` | `offensive` | `unknown`
- **Example:** `risk: safe`
- **Guide:**
  - `none` — pure text/reasoning, no commands or mutations
  - `safe` — reads files, runs non-destructive commands
  - `critical` — modifies state, deletes files, pushes to production
  - `offensive` — pentesting/red-team tools; **must** include "Authorized Use Only" warning
  - `unknown` — legacy or unclassified; prefer a concrete level for new skills

#### `source`
- **What it is:** Attribution for the skill's origin
- **Format:** URL or a short label
- **Examples:** `source: community`, `source: "https://example.com/original"`
- **Use `"self"`** if you are the original author

#### `source_repo`
- **What it is:** Canonical GitHub repository identifier for external upstream material
- **Format:** `OWNER/REPO`
- **Example:** `source_repo: Dimillian/Skills`
- **When required:** Use it when the skill adapts or imports material from an external GitHub repository

#### `source_type`
- **What it is:** Which README credits bucket the upstream repo belongs to
- **Values:** `official` | `community` | `self`
- **Examples:** `source_type: official`, `source_type: community`
- **Rule:** `self` means no external README repo credit is required

#### `date_added`
- **What it is:** Date the skill entered this repository
- **Format:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Example:** `date_added: "2026-03-06"`
- **Note:** Validation treats this as advisory for legacy content, but new contributions should include it.

### Optional Fields

Some skills include additional metadata:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: "Brief description"
category: development
risk: safe
source: community
source_repo: owner/repo
source_type: community
date_added: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "your-name-or-handle"
tags: ["react", "typescript", "testing"]
tools: [claude, cursor, gemini]
---
```

#### `license` *(optional)*
- **What it is:** SPDX license identifier for the upstream source material
- **Format:** A valid SPDX expression (e.g. `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `CC-BY-4.0`)
- **Example:** `license: MIT`
- **When to use:** Declare when `source_repo` points to material under a known license. Omitting it signals "license not verified" to downstream tooling.

#### `license_source` *(optional)*
- **What it is:** Direct URL to the upstream license file
- **Format:** Full URL string
- **Example:** `license_source: "https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/main/LICENSE"`
- **When to use:** Include alongside `license:` so automated tooling can verify the claim. If the upstream repo has no LICENSE file, omit this field.

### Source-credit contract

- External GitHub-derived skills should declare both `source_repo` and `source_type`.
- `source_type: official` means the repo must appear in `README.md` under `### Official Sources`.
- `source_type: community` means the repo must appear in `README.md` under `### Community Contributors`.
- `source: self` plus `source_type: self` is the correct shape for original repository content.
- PR CI checks README credit coverage for changed skills, so missing or misbucketed repo credits will block the PR once `source_repo` is declared.

## Part 2: Content

After the frontmatter comes the actual skill content. Here's the recommended structure:

### Recommended Sections

#### 1. Title (H1)
```markdown
# Skill Title
```
- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Usually matches or expands on the skill name

#### 2. Overview
```markdown
## Overview

A brief explanation of what this skill does and why it exists.
2-4 sentences is perfect.
```

#### 3. When to Use
```markdown
## When to Use This Skill

- Use when you need to [scenario 1]
- Use when working with [scenario 2]
- Use when the user asks about [scenario 3]
```

**Why this matters:** Helps the AI know when to activate this skill

#### 4. Core Instructions
```markdown
## How It Works

### Step 1: [Action]
Detailed instructions...

### Step 2: [Action]
More instructions...
```

**This is the heart of your skill** - clear, actionable steps

#### 5. Examples
````markdown
## Examples

### Example 1: [Use Case]
```javascript
// Example code
```

### Example 2: [Another Use Case]
```javascript
// More code
```
````

**Why examples matter:** They show the AI exactly what good output looks like

#### 6. Best Practices
```markdown
## Best Practices

- ✅ Do this
- ✅ Also do this
- ❌ Don't do this
- ❌ Avoid this
```

#### 7. Common Pitfalls
```markdown
## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Description
  **Solution:** How to fix it
```

#### 8. Security & Safety Notes (for command/network/offensive skills)

If your skill includes:

- shell commands or command-like examples,
- remote fetch/install or token usage guidance,
- file mutation, destructive actions, or privileged operations,

add a dedicated section before final wrap-up:

```markdown
## Security & Safety Notes

- This is safe/unsafe scope
- Required confirmation or authorization
- Example allowlist notes (if needed):
  `<!-- security-allowlist: ... -->`
```

#### 9. Related Skills
```markdown
## Related Skills

- `@other-skill` - When to use this instead
- `@complementary-skill` - How this works together
```

## Writing Effective Instructions

### Use Clear, Direct Language

**❌ Bad:**
```markdown
You might want to consider possibly checking if the user has authentication.
```

**✅ Good:**
```markdown
Check if the user is authenticated before proceeding.
```

### Use Action Verbs

**❌ Bad:**
```markdown
The file should be created...
```

**✅ Good:**
```markdown
Create the file...
```

### Be Specific

**❌ Bad:**
```markdown
Set up the database properly.
```

**✅ Good:**
```markdown
1. Create a PostgreSQL database
2. Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
3. Seed initial data: `npm run seed`
```

---

## Formatting Best Practices

### Use Markdown Effectively

#### Code Blocks
Always specify the language:
````markdown
```javascript
const example = "code";
```
````

#### Lists
Use consistent formatting:
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 2.1
  - Sub-item 2.2
```

#### Emphasis
- **Bold** for important terms: `**important**`
- *Italic* for emphasis: `*emphasis*`
- `Code` for commands/code: `` `code` ``

#### Links
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```
