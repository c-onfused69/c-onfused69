# 🌌 Antigravity Awesome Skills: 1,494+ Agentic Skills for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot & More

> **Installable GitHub library of 1,494+ agentic skills for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and other AI coding assistants.**

Antigravity Awesome Skills is an installable GitHub library and npm installer for reusable `SKILL.md` playbooks. It is designed for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Kiro, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding assistants that benefit from structured operating instructions. Instead of collecting one-off prompt snippets, this repository gives you a searchable, installable catalog of skills, bundles, workflows, plugin-safe distributions, and practical docs that help agents perform recurring tasks with better context, stronger constraints, and clearer outputs.

You can use this repo to install a broad multi-tool skill library, start from role-based bundles, or jump into workflow-driven execution for planning, coding, debugging, testing, security review, infrastructure, product work, and growth tasks. The root README is intentionally a high-signal landing page: understand what the project is, install it quickly, choose the right tool path, and then follow deeper docs only when you need them.

## Installation

Most users should start with the full library install and use bundles or workflows to narrow down what to try first.

### Full library install

```bash
# Default: ~/.agents/skills (Antigravity 2.0 global). Use --path for other locations.
npx antigravity-awesome-skills

# Antigravity CLI slash commands (agy): ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --agy
```

The npm installer uses a shallow, release-pinned clone by default so first-run installs stay lighter than a full repository history checkout while matching the published npm package version. Use `--tag main` only when you intentionally want the current repository tip.

### Verify the install

```bash
test -d ~/.agents/skills && echo "Skills installed in ~/.agents/skills"
```

### Run your first skill

```text
Use @brainstorming to plan a SaaS MVP.
```

### Prefer plugins for Claude Code or Codex?

- Use the full library install when you want the broadest catalog and direct control over your installed skills directory.
- Use the plugin route when you want a marketplace-style, plugin-safe distribution for Claude Code or Codex.
- Read [Plugins for Claude Code and Codex](docs/users/plugins.md) for the full breakdown of full-library install vs plugin install vs bundle plugins.

## Quick FAQ

### What is Antigravity Awesome Skills?

It is an installable GitHub library of reusable `SKILL.md` playbooks for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, and related AI coding assistants. The repo packages those skills with an installer CLI, bundles, workflows, generated catalogs, and docs so you can move from discovery to daily usage quickly.

### How do I install it?

Run `npx antigravity-awesome-skills` for the default full-library install, or use a tool-specific flag such as `--codex`, `--cursor`, `--gemini`, `--claude`, or `--antigravity` when you want the installer to target a known skills directory directly.

### Should I use the full library or a plugin?

Use the full library if you want the biggest catalog and direct filesystem control. Use plugins when you want a marketplace-style, plugin-safe distribution for Claude Code or Codex. The complete explanation lives in [Plugins for Claude Code and Codex](docs/users/plugins.md).

### Where do I browse bundles, workflows, and the full catalog?

Start with [Bundles](docs/users/bundles.md) for role-based recommendations, [Workflows](docs/users/workflows.md) for ordered execution playbooks, [CATALOG.md](CATALOG.md) for the full registry, and the hosted [GitHub Pages catalog](https://sickn33.github.io/antigravity-awesome-skills/) when you want a browsable web UI.

## Best Skills By Tool

If you want a faster answer than "browse all 1,494+ skills", start with a tool-specific guide:

- **[Claude Code skills](docs/users/claude-code-skills.md)**: install paths, starter skills, prompt examples, and plugin marketplace flow.
- **[Cursor skills](docs/users/cursor-skills.md)**: best starter skills for `.cursor/skills/`, UI-heavy work, and pair-programming flows.
- **[Codex CLI skills](docs/users/codex-cli-skills.md)**: planning, implementation, debugging, and review skills for local coding loops.
- **[Gemini CLI skills](docs/users/gemini-cli-skills.md)**: starter stack for research, agent systems, integrations, and engineering workflows.
- **[AI agent skills guide](docs/users/ai-agent-skills.md)**: how to evaluate skill libraries, choose breadth vs curation, and pick the right starting point.

### Universal starter skills

- `@brainstorming` for planning before implementation.
- `@test-driven-development` for TDD-oriented work.
- `@debugging-strategies` for systematic troubleshooting.
- `@lint-and-validate` for lightweight quality checks.
- `@security-auditor` for security-focused reviews.
- `@frontend-design` for UI and interaction quality.
- `@api-design-principles` for API shape and consistency.
- `@create-pr` for packaging work into a clean pull request.

### Real prompt examples

```text
Use @brainstorming to turn this product idea into a concrete MVP plan.
```

```text
Use @security-auditor to review this API endpoint for auth and validation risks.
```

## Bundles & Workflows

Bundles help you choose where to start. Workflows help you execute skills in the right order.

### Start with bundles

Bundles are curated groups of recommended skills for a role or goal such as `Web Wizard`, `Security Engineer`, or `OSS Maintainer`.

- Bundles are recommendations, not separate installs.
- Install the repository once, then use [docs/users/bundles.md](docs/users/bundles.md) to pick a starting set.
- Good starter combinations:
  - SaaS MVP: `Essentials` + `Full-Stack Developer` + `QA & Testing`
  - Production hardening: `Security Developer` + `DevOps & Cloud` + `Observability & Monitoring`
  - OSS shipping: `Essentials` + `OSS Maintainer`

### Use workflows for outcome-driven execution

- Read [docs/users/workflows.md](docs/users/workflows.md) for human-readable playbooks.
- Use [data/workflows.json](data/workflows.json) for machine-readable workflow metadata.
- Initial workflows include shipping a SaaS MVP, security audits, AI agent systems, QA/browser automation, and DDD-oriented design work.

### Need fewer active skills at runtime?

If Antigravity starts hitting context limits with too many active skills, the activation guidance in [docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md](docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md) can materialize only the bundles or skill ids you want in the live Antigravity directory.

If you use OpenCode or another `.agents/skills` host, prefer a reduced install up front instead of copying the full library into a context-sensitive runtime. The installer now supports `--risk`, `--category`, and `--tags` so you can keep the installed set narrow.

## Troubleshooting

Keep the root README short; use the dedicated docs for recovery and platform-specific guidance.

- If you are confused after installation, start with the [Usage Guide](docs/users/usage.md).
- If you integrate antigravity-awesome-skills into a host, read the discovery contract first: [Stable Skills Manifest v1](docs/users/discovery-manifest.md).
- For Windows truncation or context crash loops, use [docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md](docs/users/windows-truncation-recovery.md).
- For Linux/macOS overload or selective activation, use [docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md](docs/users/agent-overload-recovery.md).
- For OpenCode or other `.agents/skills` installs, prefer a reduced install such as `npx antigravity-awesome-skills --path .agents/skills --category development,backend --risk safe,none`.
- For plugin install details, host compatibility, and marketplace-safe distribution, use [docs/users/plugins.md](docs/users/plugins.md).
- For contributor expectations and guardrails, use [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Stable Skills Manifest v1

Host integrations should use:

- [`skills_index.json`](./skills_index.json) as the **canonical array-format manifest**.
- [`schemas/skills-index.v1.schema.json`](./schemas/skills-index.v1.schema.json) for the JSON shape.
- [`data/skills_index.json`](./data/skills_index.json) as the compatibility mirror.

This keeps discovery stable (`id`, `path`, metadata) while ensuring hosts only load `SKILL.md` for requested `@skill-id` values.

## Support the Project
