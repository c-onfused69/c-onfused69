# Antigravity Skill Bundles

> **Curated collections of skills organized by role and expertise level.** Don't know where to start? Pick a bundle below to get a curated set of skills for your role.

> These packs are curated starter recommendations for humans. Generated bundle ids in `data/bundles.json` are broader catalog/workflow groupings and do not need to map 1:1 to the editorial packs below.

> **Important:** bundles are installable plugin subsets and activation presets, not invokable mega-skills such as `@web-wizard` or `/essentials-bundle`. Use the individual skills listed in the pack, install the bundle as a dedicated marketplace plugin, or use the activation scripts if you want only that bundle's skills active in your live Antigravity directory.

> **Plugin compatibility:** root plugins and bundle plugins only publish plugin-safe skills. If a bundle shows `pending hardening`, the skills still exist in the repository, but that bundle is not yet published for that target. `Requires manual setup` means the bundle is installable, but one or more included skills need an explicit setup step before first use.

## Quick Start

1. **Install the repository or bundle plugin:**

   ```bash
   npx antigravity-awesome-skills
   # or clone manually
   git clone https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills.git .agent/skills
   ```

2. **Choose your bundle** from the list below based on your role or interests.

3. **Use bundle plugins or individual skills** in your AI assistant:
   - Claude Code: install the matching marketplace bundle plugin, or invoke `>> /skill-name help me...`
   - Codex CLI / Codex app: install the matching bundle plugin where plugin marketplaces are available, or invoke `Use skill-name...`
   - Cursor: `@skill-name` in chat
   - Gemini CLI: `Use skill-name...`

If you want a bundle to behave like a focused active subset instead of a full install, use:

- macOS/Linux: `./scripts/activate-skills.sh --clear Essentials`
- macOS/Linux: `./scripts/activate-skills.sh --clear "Web Wizard"`
- Windows: `.\scripts\activate-skills.bat --clear Essentials`

## 📚 How to Use Bundles

### 1) Pick by immediate goal

- Need to ship a feature now: `Essentials` + one domain pack (`Web Wizard`, `Python Pro`, `DevOps & Cloud`).
- Need reliability and hardening: add `QA & Testing` + `Security Developer`.
- Need product growth: add `Startup Founder` or `Marketing & Growth`.

### 2) Start with 3-5 skills, not 20

Pick the minimum set for your current milestone. Expand only when you hit a real gap.

### 3) Invoke skills consistently

- **Claude Code**: install a bundle plugin or use `>> /skill-name help me...`
- **Codex CLI**: install a bundle plugin where marketplaces are available, or use `Use skill-name...`
- **Cursor**: `@skill-name` in chat
- **Gemini CLI**: `Use skill-name...`

### 4) Build your personal shortlist

Keep a small list of high-frequency skills and reuse it across tasks to reduce context switching.
