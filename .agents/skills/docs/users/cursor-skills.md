# Cursor Skills

If you searched for **Cursor skills** on GitHub, this repository is built to be a practical starting point: installable skills, clear usage docs, and a large library that works well with Cursor chat workflows.

Antigravity Awesome Skills supports Cursor through the `.cursor/skills/` path and keeps the entry point simple: install once, then invoke the skills you need in chat.

## How to use Antigravity Awesome Skills with Cursor

Install the library into Cursor's skills directory, then call skills directly in chat with `@skill-name`. Cursor works especially well when you combine planning, implementation, and validation skills inside one conversation.

## Why use this repo for Cursor

- It supports Cursor directly with a dedicated install flag.
- It works well for UI-heavy and full-stack workflows where Cursor users often want planning, implementation, validation, and debugging in one place.
- It includes bundles and workflows, which are helpful when you do not want to hand-pick from a huge catalog immediately.
- It is broad enough for frontend, backend, infra, testing, product, and growth work without switching repositories.

## Install Cursor Skills

```bash
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --cursor
```

### Verify the install

```bash
test -d .cursor/skills || test -d ~/.cursor/skills
```
