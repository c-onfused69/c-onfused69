# Gemini CLI Skills

If you are evaluating **Gemini CLI skills** on GitHub, this repository is a strong broad starting point: installable skills, large coverage, and clear onboarding for day-one use.

Antigravity Awesome Skills supports Gemini CLI through the `.gemini/skills/` path and combines general engineering playbooks with specialized skills for AI systems, integrations, infrastructure, testing, product, and growth.

## How to use Antigravity Awesome Skills with Gemini CLI

Install into the Gemini skills path, then ask Gemini to apply one skill at a time to a specific task. This works best when you keep the active set small and choose a clear workflow-oriented skill for the job in front of you.

## Why use this repo for Gemini CLI

- It installs directly into the expected Gemini skills path.
- It includes both core software engineering skills and deeper agent/LLM-oriented skills.
- It helps new users get started with bundles and workflows rather than forcing a cold start from 1,689+ files.
- It is useful whether you want a broad internal skill library or a single repo to test many workflows quickly.

## Install Gemini CLI Skills

```bash
npx antigravity-awesome-skills --gemini
```

### Verify the install

```bash
test -d .gemini/skills || test -d ~/.gemini/skills
