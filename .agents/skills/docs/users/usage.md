# Usage Guide: How to Actually Use These Skills

> **Confused after installation?** This guide walks you through exactly what to do next, step by step.

---

## "I just installed the repository. Now what?"

Great question! Here's what just happened and what to do next:

If you came in through a **Claude Code** or **Codex** plugin instead of a full library install, the mental model is the same: you still invoke individual skills in prompts. The main difference is that plugins ship the plugin-safe subset. See [plugins.md](plugins.md) for the install model.

### What You Just Did

When you ran `npx antigravity-awesome-skills` or cloned the repository, you:

✅ **Downloaded 1,689+ skill files** to your computer (default: `~/.agents/skills/`; or a custom path like `~/.agent/skills/` if you used `--path`)
✅ **Made them available** to your AI assistant  
❌ **Did NOT enable them all automatically** (they're just sitting there, waiting)

Think of it like installing a toolbox. You have all the tools now, but you need to **pick which ones to use** for each job.

---

## Step 1: Understanding "Bundles" (Recommendations or Focused Installs)

**Common confusion:** "Do I need to download each skill separately?"

**Answer: NO!** You do not need to download each skill separately. Here's what bundles actually are:

### What Bundles Are

Bundles are **curated groups** of skills organized by role. They help you decide which skills to start using, and they can also be exposed as focused marketplace plugins for Claude Code and Codex.

**Analogy:**

- You installed a toolbox with 1,689+ tools (✅ done)
- Bundles are like **labeled organizer trays** saying: "If you're a carpenter, start with these 10 tools"
- You can either **pick skills from the tray** or install that tray as a focused marketplace bundle plugin

### What Bundles Are NOT

❌ Separate skill downloads  
❌ Invokable mega-skills like `@essentials` or `/web-wizard`
❌ Something most users need to activate during normal install
❌ A replacement for invoking the individual skills inside the bundle

### Example: The "Web Wizard" Bundle

When you see the [Web Wizard bundle](bundles.md#-the-web-wizard-pack), it lists:

- `frontend-design`
- `react-best-practices`
- `tailwind-patterns`
- etc.

These are **recommendations** for which skills a web developer should try first. If you have the full library installed, you just need to **use them in your prompts**. If you prefer a narrower install surface, you can install the matching bundle plugin in Claude Code or Codex where plugin marketplaces are available.

The key distinction is:

- **full library install** = broadest catalog
- **root plugin** = broad plugin-safe distribution
- **bundle plugin** = curated plugin-safe subset

See [plugins.md](plugins.md) for the canonical explanation.

If you want only one bundle active at a time in Antigravity, use the activation scripts instead of trying to invoke the bundle name directly:

```bash
./scripts/activate-skills.sh --clear Essentials
./scripts/activate-skills.sh --clear "Web Wizard"
```

---

## Step 2: How to Actually Execute/Use a Skill

This is the part that should have been explained better! Here's how to use skills:

### The Simple Answer

**Just mention the skill name in your conversation with your AI assistant.**

### Different Tools, Different Syntax

The exact syntax varies by tool, but it's always simple:

#### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
# In your terminal/chat with Claude Code:
>> Use @brainstorming to help me design a todo app
```

#### Cursor (IDE)

```bash
# In the Cursor chat panel:
@brainstorming help me design a todo app
```

#### Gemini CLI

```bash
# In your conversation with Gemini:
Use the brainstorming skill to help me plan my app
```

If Gemini CLI starts hanging after a few turns, try a fresh conversation and temporarily reduce the active set to just 2-5 skills to rule out context growth.

#### Codex CLI

```bash
# In your conversation with Codex:
Apply @brainstorming to design a new feature
```

#### Antigravity IDE

```bash
# In agent mode:
Use @brainstorming to plan this feature
```

> **Pro Tip:** Most modern tools use the `@skill-name` syntax. When in doubt, try that first!

---

## Step 3: What Should My Prompts Look Like?

Here are **real-world examples** of good prompts:

### Example 1: Starting a New Project

**Bad Prompt:**

> "Help me build a todo app"

**Good Prompt:**

> "Use @brainstorming to help me design a todo app with user authentication and cloud sync"

**Why it's better:** You're explicitly invoking the skill and providing context.

---

### Example 2: Reviewing Code

**Bad Prompt:**

> "Check my code"

**Good Prompt:**

> "Use @lint-and-validate to check `src/components/Button.tsx` for issues"

**Why it's better:** Specific skill + specific file = precise results.

---

### Example 3: Security Audit

**Bad Prompt:**

> "Make my API secure"

**Good Prompt:**

> "Use @api-security-best-practices to review my REST endpoints in `routes/api/users.js`"

**Why it's better:** The AI knows exactly which skill's standards to apply.

---

### Example 4: Combining Multiple Skills

**Good Prompt:**

> "Use @brainstorming to design a payment flow, then apply @stripe-integration to implement it"

**Why it's good:** You can chain skills together in a single prompt!

---

## Step 4: Your First Skill (Hands-On Tutorial)

Let's actually use a skill right now. Follow these steps:

### Scenario: You want to plan a new feature

1. **Pick a skill:** Let's use `brainstorming` (from the "Essentials" bundle)

2. **Open your AI assistant** (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

3. **Type this exact prompt:**

   ```
   Use @brainstorming to help me design a user profile page for my app
   ```

4. **Press Enter**

5. **What happens next:**
   - The AI loads the brainstorming skill
   - It will start asking you structured questions (one at a time)
   - It will guide you through understanding, requirements, and design
   - You answer each question, and it builds a complete spec

6. **Result:** You'll end up with a detailed design document—without writing a single line of code yet!

---

## Step 5: Picking Your First Skills (Practical Advice)

Don't try to use all 1,689+ skills at once. Here's a sensible approach:

If you want a tool-specific starting point before choosing skills, use:

- [Claude Code skills](claude-code-skills.md)
- [Cursor skills](cursor-skills.md)
- [Codex CLI skills](codex-cli-skills.md)
- [Gemini CLI skills](gemini-cli-skills.md)

### Start with "The Essentials" (5 skills, everyone needs these)

1. **`@brainstorming`** - Plan before you build
2. **`@lint-and-validate`** - Keep code clean
3. **`@git-pushing`** - Save work safely
4. **`@systematic-debugging`** - Fix bugs faster
5. **`@concise-planning`** - Organize tasks

**How to use them:**

- Before writing new code → `@brainstorming`
- After writing code → `@lint-and-validate`
- Before committing → `@git-pushing`
- When stuck → `@systematic-debugging`

### Then Add Role-Specific Skills (5-10 more)

Find your role in [bundles.md](bundles.md) and pick 5-10 skills from that bundle.

**Example for Web Developer:**

- `@frontend-design`
- `@react-best-practices`
- `@tailwind-patterns`
- `@seo-audit`

**Example for Security Engineer:**

- `@api-security-best-practices`
- `@vulnerability-scanner`
- `@ethical-hacking-methodology`

### Finally, Add On-Demand Skills (as needed)

Keep the [CATALOG.md](../../CATALOG.md) open as reference. When you need something specific:

> "I need to integrate Stripe payments"  
> → Search catalog → Find `@stripe-integration` → Use it!

---

## Complete Example: Building a Feature End-to-End

Let's walk through a realistic scenario:

### Task: "Add a blog to my Next.js website"

#### Step 1: Plan (use @brainstorming)

```
You: Use @brainstorming to design a blog system for my Next.js site

AI: [Asks structured questions about requirements]
You: [Answer questions]
AI: [Produces detailed design spec]
```

#### Step 2: Implement (use @nextjs-best-practices)

```
You: Use @nextjs-best-practices to scaffold the blog with App Router

AI: [Creates file structure, sets up routes, adds components]
```

#### Step 3: Style (use @tailwind-patterns)

```
You: Use @tailwind-patterns to make the blog posts look modern

AI: [Applies Tailwind styling with responsive design]
```

#### Step 4: SEO (use @seo-audit)

```
You: Use @seo-audit to optimize the blog for search engines

AI: [Adds meta tags, sitemaps, structured data]
```

#### Step 5: Test & Deploy

```
You: Use @test-driven-development to add tests, then @vercel-deployment to deploy

AI: [Creates tests, sets up CI/CD, deploys to Vercel]
```

**Result:** Professional blog built with best practices, without manually researching each step!

## Common Questions

### "Which tool should I use? Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini?"

**Any of them!** Skills work universally. Pick the tool you already use or prefer:

- **Claude Code** - Best for terminal/CLI workflows
- **Cursor** - Best for IDE integration
- **Gemini CLI** - Best for Google ecosystem
- **Codex CLI** - Best for OpenAI ecosystem

### "Can I see all available skills?"

Yes! Three ways:

1. Browse [CATALOG.md](../../CATALOG.md) (searchable list)
2. Run `ls ~/.agents/skills/` (or your actual install path)
3. Ask your AI: "What skills do you have for [topic]?"

### "Do I need to restart my IDE after installing?"

Usually no, but if your AI doesn't recognize a skill:

1. Try restarting your IDE/CLI
2. Check the installation path matches your tool
3. Try the explicit path: `npx antigravity-awesome-skills --claude` (or `--cursor`, `--gemini`, etc.)

### "Can I load all skills into the model at once?"

No. Even though you have 1,689+ skills installed locally, you should **not** concatenate every `SKILL.md` into a single system prompt or context block.

The intended pattern is:

- use `skills_index.json` (canonical discovery manifest) to discover which skills exist; and
- use `data/skills_index.json` only when your host reads from `data/` for compatibility;
- only load the `SKILL.md` files for the specific `@skill-id` values you actually use in a conversation.

If you are building your own host/agent (e.g. Jetski/Cortex + Gemini), see:

- [`docs/integrations/jetski-cortex.md`](../integrations/jetski-cortex.md)

The v1 manifest shape is defined in:

- [`schemas/skills-index.v1.schema.json`](../../schemas/skills-index.v1.schema.json)
- [`discovery-manifest.md`](discovery-manifest.md)

### "Can I create my own skills?"

Yes! Use the `@skill-creator` skill:

```
Use @skill-creator to help me build a custom skill for [your task]
```

### "What if a skill doesn't work as expected?"

1. Check the skill's `SKILL.md` file directly in your installed path, for example: `~/.agents/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
2. Read the description to ensure you're using it correctly
3. [Open an issue](https://github.com/sickn33/antigravity-awesome-skills/issues) with details
